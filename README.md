# CNN Model for Cat and Dog Classification Using Transfer Learning (VGG16)

## Project Overview

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model leverages transfer learning using the VGG16 architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Fine-tuning techniques were applied to enhance the model's performance on the specific task of classifying cats and dogs.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using the following architecture:

- **Base Model**: VGG16 pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
- **Transfer Learning**: The base model's convolutional layers are frozen, and a new fully connected (dense) layer is added on top of the base model for classification.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The last few layers of the VGG16 base model are unfrozen, allowing them to be retrained alongside the new fully connected layers. This helps in fine-tuning the model to better fit the cat and dog classification task.

### Layers:
- **Input Layer**: (150x150x3) - Images are resized to 150x150 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).
- **VGG16 Base Model**: All convolutional layers from VGG16 (with weights pre-trained on ImageNet).
- **Fully Connected Layers**: 
  - Dense Layer with ReLU activation
  - Dropout Layer to prevent overfitting
  - Output Layer with Sigmoid activation for binary classification

### Optimizer & Loss:
- **Optimizer**: RMSprop with a learning rate of 1e-5
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

## Dataset

- **Training Data**: The model was trained on a dataset of cat and dog images. The images were organized into two subdirectories, one for each class.
- **Validation Data**: A separate dataset was used for validation to evaluate the model's performance during training.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the dataset:**

   Place the training and validation images in the appropriate directories:
   - `train/`: Containing subdirectories for each class (e.g., `train/cats/`, `train/dogs/`)
   - `test/`: Containing subdirectories for each class (e.g., `test/cats/`, `test/dogs/`)

## Usage

1. **Training the Model:**

   To train the model, run:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   This script will train the model using the training data and validate it using the validation data.

2. **Making Predictions:**

   To use the trained model to classify a new image, run:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path /path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to classify.

## Results

- **Training Accuracy**: Achieved ~83.6% accuracy on the training dataset.
- **Validation Accuracy**: Achieved ~92.2% accuracy on the validation dataset.

The model shows good generalization with a higher validation accuracy than training accuracy, indicating that the fine-tuning approach was effective.

## Future Work

- **Expand the Dataset**: Include more images and additional classes (e.g., other animals) to improve the model's robustness.
- **Experiment with Other Architectures**: Test other pre-trained models like ResNet, Inception, or EfficientNet for potentially better performance.
- **Deploy the Model**: Deploy the model using a web framework like Flask or a tool like Streamlit for easy accessibility.
